### 2. Download a supported version of YouTube / YouTube Music / Reddit

Go to [apkmirror.com](https://www.apkmirror.com/) and download a supported version of the app you want to patch.

You must download the `nodpi` variant, and the architecture must be compatible with the device you plan to install the patched APK on.
